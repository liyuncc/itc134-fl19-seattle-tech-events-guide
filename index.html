    <h2>Plan to network</h2>
    <p>At most networking events, you will have to market yourself in an effective and concise way, so be prepared to pitch yourself!</p>
    <p>Be able to speak to your current state in just a few sentences: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where do you work and what do you do?</li>
            <li>If you’re a student, where and what are you studying?</li>
            <li>What is your professional history?</li>
            <li>If what you’ve done diverges from what you’d like to do, why the transition?</li>
            <li>What do you want?</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Practice your responses to standard questions like these so communication is natural, flows easily, and you can divert your energy to unanticipated prompts.</p>
    <p>Are you looking to speak to specific individuals? </p>
        <ul>
